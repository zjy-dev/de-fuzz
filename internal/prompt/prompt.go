Your mission is to craft a high-quality, detailed **System Prompt**. This prompt will be given to another AI assistant whose sole job is to generate and mutate C code to fuzz a compiler's security features. The effectiveness of the entire fuzzing process depends on the quality of your system prompt.

**[CONTEXT]**

Target ISA: %s
Defense Strategy: %s

[ISA Stack Layout of the target compiler]
%s

[Defense Strategy Source Code]
%s

**[YOUR TASK]**

Analyze the provided context and generate a **System Prompt**. This prompt must be a comprehensive guide for the other AI. It should be structured to make the AI an expert on this specific fuzzing task.

The generated System Prompt **MUST** contain the following sections:

1.  **`+"`## Goal`"+`**: A clear and concise statement of the objective. (e.g., "Your goal is to generate and mutate C code to discover vulnerabilities in the '%s' defense strategy on the '%s' architecture.")

2.  **`+"`## Core Concepts`"+`**: A detailed explanation of the defense strategy and the ISA's stack layout. You must synthesize the provided context, not just copy it. Explain *how* the defense works and what its theoretical weaknesses are.

3.  **`+"`## Attack Vectors & Vulnerability Patterns`"+`**: This is the most critical section. Provide a bulleted list of specific, actionable attack ideas and C code patterns to try. Be creative and think like an attacker. Examples:
    *   Integer overflows to bypass bounds checks.
    *   Tricky pointer arithmetic to confuse alias analysis.
    *   Using `+"`longjmp`"+` or other control-flow manipulation to skip security checks.
    *   Exploiting format string vulnerabilities in novel ways.

4.  **`+"`## Seed Generation & Mutation Rules`"+`**: Clear instructions for the AI on how to format its output. It must produce a complete C source file and a Makefile, as well as a run.sh, and mutations should be small and intelligent.

**[OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS]**

-   You must only output the generated **System Prompt**.
-   Do not include any other text, conversation, or explanations.
-   The output should be formatted in Markdown.

/*
--- UPDATE CODE PLAN ---

1.  **Create `readFileOrDefault` helper:**
    -   Create a private helper function `readFileOrDefault(path string) (string, error)`.
    -   This function will read the file at `path`.
    -   If `os.IsNotExist(err)`, it will return `"Not available for now"` and `nil`.
    -   For other errors, it will return `""` and the error.
    -   If successful, it returns the file content as a string.

2.  **Modify `BuildUnderstandPrompt`:**
    -   Change the signature to `BuildUnderstandPrompt(isa, strategy, basePath string) (string, error)`.
    -   Define paths for context files:
        -   `stackLayoutPath := filepath.Join(basePath, "stack_layout.md")`
        -   `sourceCodePath := filepath.Join(basePath, "defense_strategy.c")`
    -   Call `readFileOrDefault` for both paths to get their content.
    -   Update the prompt template to include new sections for "ISA Stack Layout" and "Defense Strategy Source Code", populating them with the content read from the files.
